## Introduction

`plu-ts` is a library designed for building Cardano dApps in an efficient and developer friendly way.

It is composed of two main parts:

- `plu-ts/onchain`: an [eDSL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language#External_and_Embedded_Domain_Specific_Languages) (embedded Domain Specific Language) that leverages Typescript as the host language; designed to generate efficient Smart Contracts.
- `plu-ts/offchain`: a set of classes and functions that allow reuse of onchain types.
