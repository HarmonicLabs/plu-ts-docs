# `TxBuilder`

`plu-ts/offchain` exposes the `TxBuilder` class.

## How to use

Its purpose is to allow you to build transactions more easly.

You could infact build transactions by calling the [`Tx`](../cardano-ledger-ts/classes/Tx) constructor.

However that requires a profound understanding of the structure of a Cardano transaction.

for this reason we have the `TxBuilder`.

You can get your `TxBuilder` by passing the [`ProtocolParameters`](../cardano-ledger-ts/interfaces/ProtocolParameters) (that you'll need to query)
needed for the network you are building transactions for.

constructor definiton:
```ts
constructor(
    protocolParamters: Readonly<ProtocolParameters>,
    genesisInfos?: GenesisInfos
)
```

example:
```ts
type MyFavoriteServiceResponse = any

// you'll need to adapt the protocol parameters
// to the expected interface
function adaptServiceProtocolParams(
    response: MyFavoriteServiceResponse
): ProtocolParameters
{
    /* do your magic */
}

const txBuilder = new TxBuilder(
    adaptServiceProtocolParams(
        await fetch("my-favorite-service.com/api/protocol-parameters")
    )
);
```

## Methods

once you have your tx builder you can use all the following methods.

- [`buildSync`](./buildSync)
- [`runWithProvider`](./runWithProvider)
- [`keepRelevant`](./keepRelevant)
- [`calcLinearFee`](./calcLinearFee)
- [`getMinimumOutputLovelaces`](./getMinimumOutputLovelaces)
- [`setGenesisInfos`](./setGenesisInfos)
- [`slotToPOSIX`](./slotToPOSIX)
- [`posixToSlot`](./posixToSlot)
- [`overrideTxRedeemers`](./overrideTxRedeemers)

## `buildSync` or `runWithProvider`

once you have a `TxBuilder` instance there are 2 ways to build a transaction:

1) using [`buildSync`](./buildSync)
2) getting a [`TxBuilderRunner`](../TxBuilderRunner%20API/TxBuilderRunner) by passing a
[`Partial<IProvider>`](../TxBuilderRunner%20API/IProvider#iprovider) to the [`runWithProvider`](./runWithProvider) method

### Pro and Cons

The [`buildSync`](./buildSync) method gives you full controll,
you need to query the resolved utxos for the inputs,
as well any other information required for transaction validation.

Once you provide the data as specified in by [`ITxBuildArgs`](./buildSync#itxbuildargs)
the `TxBuilder` instance will syncronously build and validate your transaction.

If you don't want to take care of querying the data, you can pass a [`Provider`](../TxBuilderRunner%20API/IProvider#iprovider)
to the [`runWithProvider`](./runWithProvider) method,
to get a [`TxBuilderRunner`](../TxBuilderRunner%20API/TxBuilderRunner) instance.

The runner has many method that abstract the [`buildSync`](./buildSync) interface,
so that you can describe your transaction an a much higher level,
and if some that is missing it will be queried asynchronously using the [`Provider`](../TxBuilderRunner%20API/IProvider#iprovider) that was passed.
